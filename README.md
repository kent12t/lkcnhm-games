# README

Welcome to the `lkcnhm-games` repository!

## Description

This repository contains a collection of games developed by [Kent](https://github.com/kent12t). The original code is part of a bigger, private repo which was developed by me and [Yuta](https://github.com/didny) and launched as the LKCNHM* app (available on Apple App Store and Google Play Store). The app is an NFC-enabled, gamified museum app which encourages learning while exploring the museum space. Please open the game on mobile only, or inspect element and put it on mobile mode. The games are all developed using p5.js. Assets are attributed to [Kiwi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiwichan/).

## Games

1. Dragging
    - Identify which animals are from the West and East of the Wallace Line

2. Finding
    - Find 4 hidden insects in the vertically scrollable forest
    - Forest artwork is based on Wallace's historical record/imagery

3. Snapping
    - Irregular polygon snapping puzzle game, fit in the naturalists' gears into the right luggage space

4. Sorting
    - Sort 4 insects into their corresponding classification boxes

## To-do List
- [x] Add a readme page
- [ ] Implement adaptive layout for wider screens (slightly tougher on a purely p5.js app to be honest)
- [ ] Implement back button
- [ ] Redo the UI for `index.html`
